Special Thanks to 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript
for providing the tutorial necessary to complete this project.

This project is for ETSU's ACM Game Jam Spring 2023.
It lasted from late February to late March.

THEME: Time is Power.
It's Breakout, but MLG.

How does this project fit the theme?
- At first, the hitsounds sound weak. They're little taps.
- As the ball speeds up, more hitsounds happen, and they hit HARDER!
- Faster completion means more power. Hence, (less) time is power.

This project took about 2 weeks of spare time to complete.
It was fun. But it became even MORE fun when I made it UNIQUE!

Why I chose JavaScript
	- Back in High School, JavaScript was my first coding language (actually HTML, but ignore that).
	- I remember making a cave helicopter game using JavaScript.
	- I am currently learning (more) JavaScript in Advanced Topics in Web Development.
	- I would like to inspire myself by creating this project.

What I learned completing this project:
	- How to make GAMES using JAVASCRIPT!!!
	- How to use <script> tags in JavaScript.
	- The basic layout of an HTML page (again).
	- Creating a canvas.

	- How to add, get, and play mp3 files using HTML DOM's Audio method.
		- https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_audio_play.asp
	- Some other methods and classes provided by the HTML Document Object Model.
	- Reinforcing my knowledge of JavaScript using document.getElementById();
		- By the way, getting elements like this seems to be more OP than instructors tell students.

	- Event Listeners (Mouse Input and Keyboard Input)
	- AND MORE!


What I got from completing this project:
	- More knowledge about JavaScript
	- A cool website to show off my MLG coding skills.
	- Practical use of my Physics knowledge from my Physics class.
